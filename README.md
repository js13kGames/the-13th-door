You control Pip, who has Triskaidekaphobia, the fear of the number 13. His doctor has recommended a session within the "Exposure Therapy" escape room as a way to cure his fear. The escape room is a series of 49 rooms connected in a maze. In these rooms, Pip will encounter 13 numbered doors of varying colour, 13 golden coins, and 13 ghosts protecting the locked doors. Will sustained exposure work?
